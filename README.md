# Morse-Converter
Conversion of morse code to ascii text using a touch sensor

Board: Arduino ESP32

IDE: Arduino 1.8.16

Hardware: Aluminium foil connected to the transmit (TX) pin of the esp32 using jumper cables, and an led screen to display the text output

Optional Hardware (Project Add-ons): Neopixel - blinks as the user touches the sensor, Buzzer - buzzes with a particular frequency to sound like the morse input

This device is capable of converting morse code inputted on an aluminium foil as a dot / dash to ascii text on a website (using wifi) as well as a hardwired led display screen. The device allows for cost effective, long distance encrypted communication between individuals / groups.
